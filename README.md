# CMS Performance Comparison

In the interest of research, I decided to build my new website out on a few different platforms. The platforms I plan to target are below:

- ExpressionEngine 3.3.x
- Craft 2.6.x
- Wordpress 4.5.x
- Drupal 8.x
- Statamic 2.x

The idea was to build the same site on multiple platforms. I am building them as identically as possible and noting the differences as I go along. The project goals are below:

- Identical markup and template assets
- Templates as files (for EE donâ€™t store any template data in the database)
- Identical content
- Standardize the environment: (using a local MAMP stack to eliminate any hardware variables)

If you have suggestions for other platforms that you'd like to see me test, feel free to submit an issue.

Note: No actual CMS code will be published here, only the template files that each CMS will use to render the site.
