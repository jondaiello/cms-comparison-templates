# CMS Performance Comparison

In the interest of research, I decided to build my new website out on a few different platforms. The platforms I plan to target are below:

- [ExpressionEngine 3.3.x](https://ellislab.com/expressionengine) (Free-$299)
- [Craft 2.6.x](https://craftcms.com/) (Free-$299+)
- [Statamic 2.x](https://statamic.com/) ($199+)
- [Wordpress 4.5.x](https://wordpress.org/) (Free, Open-Source)
- [Drupal 8.x](https://www.drupal.org/) (Free, Open-Source)
- [October CMS](https://octobercms.com/) (Free, Open-Source)
- [Bolt CMS](https://bolt.cm/) (Free, Open-Source)

The idea was to build the same site on multiple platforms. I am building them as identically as possible and noting the differences as I go along. The project goals are below:

- Identical markup and template assets
- Templates as files (for EE donâ€™t store any template data in the database)
- Identical content
- Keep it native (No add-ons, No plugins. Period.)
- Standardize the environment: (using a local MAMP stack to eliminate any hardware variables)

If you have suggestions for other platforms that you'd like to see me test, feel free to submit an issue.

Note: No actual CMS code will be published here, only the template files that each CMS will use to render the site.
